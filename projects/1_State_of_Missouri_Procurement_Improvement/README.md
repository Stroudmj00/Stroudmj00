# Procurement Improvement

### Project Highlights

* **Outcome:** Developed a data-driven performance management framework that earned a **2024 George Cronin Award Finalist** recognition from the National Association of State Procurement Officials (NASPO).
* **Impact:** Drove a **78% reduction in overdue bids** and a **31.4% improvement in turnaround time** for a key bid category.
* **My Role:** As a data analyst, I was a key team member responsible for implementing the software tools and developing the analytics that powered this operational transformation.
* **Challenge:** To overhaul the Missouri Division of Purchasing's slow, manual bid-tracking process and create a system that enabled data-driven decision-making.

### Framework and Results

We replaced the outdated manual process with a new system built on the **DMAIC** (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) cycle.

1.  **Centralized Data with Smartsheet:** A central worklog was created to capture real-time data for every stage of the procurement process, replacing a cumbersome 40+ page Excel file. This move alone **cut administrative time by 73%**.

2.  **Visual Performance Tracking with Tableau:** We built operational dashboards that provided at-a-glance status updates. A key innovation was a **color-coded system (Green, Yellow, Red)** that used SPC principles to automatically flag procurements based on their performance against time goals.

3.  **Driving a Culture of Improvement:** This visual feedback loop was critical. It fostered a positive and competitive culture to "Say NO to Tableau Reds" and enabled managers to quickly identify and address bottlenecks. The new clarity and accountability were directly responsible for the significant reduction in overdue bids and faster turnaround times.
