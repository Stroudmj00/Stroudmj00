# MUHC ICU Dashboard for EMR Log Data

### Project Summary

Presented at the **Nexus Informatics Conference**, this project tackles the challenge of monitoring nurse workloads by transforming massive, raw Electronic Medical Record (EMR) log data into actionable insights. I developed an interactive **R Shiny dashboard** to process and visualize EMR usage profiles from the MU Health Care (MUHC) ICU.

This tool provides a framework for researchers and hospital administrators to explore nurse activity patterns, identify workload trends, and investigate the sources of nurse burnout by analyzing millions of log records from a single 12-hour nursing shift.

### Methodology & Technical Stack

* **Primary Tools:** R, R Shiny
* **Core Methodologies:** Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, Dashboard Development, Time-Series Analysis

The dashboard allows users to filter EMR data by individual nurses and visualize key performance indicators, such as the frequency and duration of specific tasks ("timernames"), through various plots and charts.
