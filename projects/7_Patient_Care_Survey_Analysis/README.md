# Patient Care Survey Analysis

### Project Summary

* [cite_start]**Objective:** To identify barriers to dental care for children with neurodevelopmental disabilities by analyzing survey data from caregivers at the University of Missouri's Thompson Center. [cite: 676] [cite_start]The goal was to find opportunities to educate clinicians and enhance patient care. [cite: 677]

* [cite_start]**Methodology:** Collected and analyzed data from 192 caregiver surveys using **REDCap**. [cite: 685] [cite_start]The analysis focused on oral health habits, challenges, and access to care for patients aged 7 months to 17 years. [cite: 683, 686]

* [cite_start]**Key Finding:** While 94% of caregivers view dental care as very or extremely important, **Financial Constraints** were identified as the most impactful barrier to accessing that care. [cite: 695, 699, 749]

* [cite_start]**Impact:** The results highlight a clear opportunity for the clinic to improve patient outcomes by providing targeted education on oral hygiene and developing strategies to address financial and behavioral barriers to care. [cite: 718, 720, 721]
