## Columbia, Missouri Traffic Stop Analysis

This project analyzes vehicle traffic stop data from Columbia, Missouri[cite: 2]. The primary objective was to determine if factors like demographics, time, and location could predict whether a stop would result in a vehicle search[cite: 2]. Techniques included **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for feature reduction, and **logistic regression** for prediction[cite: 2]. The analysis revealed that while some factors were statistically significant, the model's overall predictive power was limited, highlighting the complexity of the issue[cite: 2].

## How to Name the Next Big Thing: Movie Title Analysis

This data storytelling project analyzes the top 100 IMDB movies to uncover patterns in movie titles that correlate with higher ratings[cite: 1, 3]. The goal was to provide actionable advice for filmmakers on naming their next movie[cite: 1, 3].

Key findings include:
* Titles with specific punctuation, like **commas**, tend to have higher average ratings[cite: 3]. Movies with commas scored an average of 0.4 points higher than those with periods[cite: 3].
* There appears to be an optimal "Goldilocks' zone" for title length, around **20-40 characters**[cite: 3]. For titles with punctuation, the analysis suggests aiming for ~40 characters, and ~20 for those without[cite: 3].
