## Columbia, Missouri Traffic Stop Analysis

This project analyzes vehicle traffic stop data from Columbia, Missouri. The primary objective was to determine if factors like demographics, time, and location could predict whether a stop would result in a vehicle search. Techniques included **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for feature reduction, and **logistic regression** for prediction. The analysis revealed that while some factors were statistically significant, the model's overall predictive power was limited, highlighting the complexity of the issue.

## How to Name the Next Big Thing: Movie Title Analysis

This data storytelling project analyzes the top 100 IMDB movies to uncover patterns in movie titles that correlate with higher ratings. The goal was to provide actionable advice for filmmakers on naming their next movie.

Key findings include:
* Titles with specific punctuation, like **commas**, tend to have higher average ratings. Movies with commas scored an average of 0.4 points higher than those with periods.
* There appears to be an optimal "Goldilocks' zone" for title length, around **20-40 characters**. For titles with punctuation, the analysis suggests aiming for ~40 characters, and ~20 for those without.
