# Onboarding_Analysis

### Project Summary

As a finalist in the State of Missouri's 2024 Iron Viz competition, I analyzed employee onboarding survey data to answer a critical business question: **How does team size impact a new employee's experience?**

I developed a narrative-driven Tableau dashboard that told a clear story: smaller teams (1-5 members) are directly correlated with higher employee satisfaction, more effective leadership, and stronger team bonds. This work was selected by the state's Tableau Center of Excellence as one of the top five submissions based on its design, storytelling, and analytical depth.

### Methodology & Key Findings

* **Domain:** HR / People Analytics
* **Tools:** Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep
* **Analysis:** Data Storytelling, Data Cleaning & Prep, Comparative Analysis

The core of the analysis was to move beyond a simple data dump and build a persuasive argument. By normalizing survey responses using "Percent of Total" calculations, I could make accurate comparisons across teams of different sizes.

The dashboard visually demonstrates that employees on smaller teams:
* Receive significantly more **one-on-one meetings** and professional development.
* Report a stronger sense of **team cohesion** and belonging.
* Perceive their leaders as **more effective** and report higher **job satisfaction**.
