# Procurement Process Control and Business Intelligence

### Project Highlights

* [cite_start]**Challenge:** The Missouri Division of Purchasing's manual, Excel-based bid tracking was slow and unmanageable. [cite: 15] [cite_start]This made it difficult to analyze performance, identify bottlenecks, or reduce procurement turnaround times. [cite: 12]
* [cite_start]**My Role:** As a data analyst with an industrial engineering background, I was a critical team member brought in to help develop and implement a new data-driven system using modern software. [cite: 26, 27, 28, 31]
* [cite_start]**Outcome:** The new system transformed the division's operations, earning a **2024 George Cronin Award Finalist** recognition from the National Association of State Procurement Officials (NASPO) and praise from the Governor of Missouri. [cite: 2]

### The Solution: A Turnaround Time Management Framework

[cite_start]We replaced the outdated process with a new framework built on the **DMAIC** (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) process improvement cycle. [cite: 36]

1.  [cite_start]**Data Capture (Smartsheet):** A cloud-based spreadsheet was used to create a central worklog, capturing real-time data for every stage of the procurement process. [cite: 21, 131]
2.  [cite_start]**Analysis & Visualization (Tableau):** We developed operational dashboards in Tableau to display key metrics and provide at-a-glance status updates. [cite: 22, 1613]
3.  [cite_start]**Performance Management (Color-Coding):** A key innovation was a **color-coded system (Green, Yellow, Red)** that automatically flagged procurements based on their performance against established time goals. [cite: 85, 90, 104] [cite_start]This provided instant visual feedback and inspired a positive, competitive culture to "Say NO to Tableau Reds." [cite: 143]

### Key Results & Impact

* **78% Reduction in Overdue Bids:** Decreased the number of "Tableau Red" bids from **36 to 8** over a 9-month period.
* [cite_start]**31.4% Faster Turnaround:** Reduced the 3-month rolling average turnaround time for a key bid type (RFP < $250k). [cite: 1545]
* [cite_start]**Enhanced Communication:** The new dashboards provided clear, up-to-date data that was used to communicate progress and improvements to stakeholders, including the state legislature. [cite: 13, 148]
* [cite_start]**National Recognition:** The project was a finalist for the prestigious **2024 George Cronin Award for Procurement Excellence**. [cite: 2]
