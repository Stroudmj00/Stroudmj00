# Patient Care Survey: Identifying Barriers to Dental Health

### Project Summary

As a data analyst for the University of Missouri's Thompson Center for Autism, I analyzed survey data to identify the primary barriers preventing children with neurodevelopmental disabilities from receiving adequate dental care.

Using **REDCap**, we collected and analyzed responses from over 200 caregivers. The analysis revealed that while 94% of caregivers believe dental care is critical, **Financial Constraints** were the most frequently cited barrier to accessing it. These findings provide a data-driven basis for the clinic to develop targeted educational materials and support strategies to improve patient outcomes. This work has been accepted for presentation at the **2025 AACPDM Annual Meeting**, a national conference.

### Methodology & Technical Stack

* **Primary Tool:** REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture)
* **Core Methodologies:** Survey Design, Data Collection, Quantitative Analysis

The project involved a two-phase data collection process, incorporating questions into standard clinic intake forms and distributing a detailed 47-question survey developed in collaboration with a multidisciplinary medical team.

### Key Findings

* **Financial Constraints are the Primary Barrier:** The most frequently cited reason for not receiving dental care was "Financial Constraints".
* **High Perceived Importance of Dental Care:** Despite the barriers, **94% of caregivers** believe that dental care is "very important" or "important".
* **Need for Targeted Support:** The findings highlight the need for the clinic to develop resources and support strategies to help families overcome financial barriers to dental care.
