# Patient Care Survey: Identifying Barriers to Dental Health

### Project Overview

As a data analyst for the University of Missouri's Thompson Center for Autism, I analyzed survey data to identify the primary barriers preventing children with neurodevelopmental disabilities from receiving adequate dental care.

Using **REDCap**, we collected and analyzed responses from over 200 caregivers. The analysis revealed that while 94% of caregivers believe dental care is critical, **Financial Constraints** were the most frequently cited barrier to accessing it. These findings provide a data-driven basis for the clinic to develop targeted educational materials and support strategies to improve patient outcomes. This work has been accepted for presentation at the **2025 AACPDM Annual Meeting**, a national conference.
