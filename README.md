## Portfolio Projects

### 1. State of Missouri - Cronin Award for Procurement Excellence
*As a Data Analyst for the State of Missouri, I spearheaded a data-driven initiative to improve procurement operations. This project earned **4th place in a national showcase** (NASPO Cronin Award Finalist) and was featured on LinkedIn by Governor Parson.*

*I designed and deployed a new turnaround time management process using Smartsheet for project management and Tableau for real-time dashboards. This system transformed the division by centralizing project tracking and providing data-driven insights, leading to a **10.6% improvement in procurement turnaround times** and a **73% reduction in administrative time**.*

### 2. Healthcare Patient Flow Simulation (Best ISE Capstone)
*As a capstone team lead, I engineered a predictive Simio model that forecasted Emergency Room bed shortages for University of Missouri Health Care. This high-fidelity simulation served as a low-cost, low-risk tool for executives to test high-stakes strategic decisions. This work was recognized as the **Best 2023 ISE Capstone Project**.*

### 3. Operating Room Optimization (Award-Winning Research)
*As team lead for the "Si-MU-lation" team, I directed a 6-person team in a research project that improved OR utilization by 26%. We implemented a custom scheduling algorithm in FlexSim, balancing efficiency with ethical constraints like staff overtime.*

*This work was recognized with multiple awards:*
* *Presented at the IISE 2023 Annual Conference.*
* ***3rd place** in the IISE regional technical paper competition.*
* ***2nd place** in the engineering research poster competition.*

### 4. Supply Chain Anomaly Detection for Product Backorders
*This project tackled the critical business problem of predicting product backorders to reduce stock-outs and improve customer satisfaction. I developed and benchmarked three unique machine learning pipelines to identify the optimal model. The best-performing pipeline (Isolation Forest → PCA → RandomForest) achieved **82% overall accuracy** and caught **74% of all backorders** on unseen data, enabling a shift from reactive firefighting to proactive inventory planning.*

### 5. EMR Nurse Workload & Burnout Analysis (Award-Winning Research)
*As an undergraduate researcher, I analyzed a large EMR dataset in R to investigate the distribution of nurse workload in an ICU. Using a Chi-Square goodness-of-fit test, I proved that EMR task frequency was not uniform among nurses, providing a data-driven basis for tailoring resource allocation to reduce burnout. This research placed **3rd and 4th** in the 2022 Spring and Fall engineering research poster competitions, respectively.*

### 6. Restaurant Process Improvement & Simulation
*A full-scale analysis of a Panchero's restaurant using Lean principles, line balancing, and Simio simulation to identify bottlenecks and provide recommendations to improve throughput and profitability.*

### 7. Community Dental Health Survey Analysis
*As a Data Analyst for the Thompson Center for Autism, I analyzed over 200 dental surveys using REDCap to identify barriers to care for children with neurodevelopmental disabilities. The findings from this research were prepared for presentation at the 2025 AACPDM Annual Meeting.*
