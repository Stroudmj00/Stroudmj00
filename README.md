## Portfolio Projects

### 1. State of Missouri - Cronin Award for Procurement Excellence
*As a Research and Data Analyst, I was a key member of the team whose work on turnaround time management earned the 2024 NASPO George Cronin Finalist Award for Procurement Excellence. Our initiative transformed the state's procurement operations from transactional chaos to strategic, data-driven management. I was one of the three official presenters on this topic at the NASPO Annual Conference.*

*We implemented a new process using Smartsheet and Tableau to track and analyze bid timelines against granular goals. This new system, recognized by Governor Mike Parson for creating real, lasting changes, produced significant, measurable improvements:*
* *The number of overdue bids ("Tableau Reds") was **reduced by 78%**, from 36 to 8, over a 9-month period.*
* *The overall number of dissatisfied customers (bids behind schedule) **decreased by 62%**.*

### 2. Healthcare Patient Flow Simulation
*Led a capstone team to build a high-fidelity Simio simulation of the University of Missouri Hospital, modeling 16 service lines to identify patient flow bottlenecks. The model served as a low-cost, low-risk tool for executives to test high-stakes strategic decisions, such as changes in discharge times or responses to increased patient demand.*

### 3. Operating Room Optimization
*An award-winning research project using FlexSim and a binary search algorithm to optimize OR scheduling, maximizing utilization while adhering to ethical constraints. The goal was to find the most effective configuration for a surgical floor by balancing performance metrics against staff overtime. The final recommended configuration achieved **78% OR utilization with zero median staff overtime**. This work was formally presented at an IISE regional conference.*

### 4. Supply Chain Anomaly Detection for Product Backorders
*This project tackled the critical business problem of predicting product backorders to reduce stock-outs and improve customer satisfaction. I developed and benchmarked three unique machine learning pipelines to identify the optimal model. The best-performing pipeline (Isolation Forest → PCA → RandomForest) achieved **82% overall accuracy** and caught **74% of all backorders** on unseen data, enabling a shift from reactive firefighting to proactive inventory planning.*

### 5. EMR Nurse Workload & Burnout Analysis
*Conducted a statistical analysis of EMR log data to investigate nurse workload distribution. Using a Chi-Square goodness-of-fit test, this research proved that EMR task frequency was not uniform among nurses (p-value < 0.05), providing a data-driven basis for tailoring resource allocation to reduce nurse burnout.*

### 6. Restaurant Process Improvement & Simulation
*A full-scale analysis of a Panchero's restaurant using Lean principles, line balancing, and Simio simulation to identify bottlenecks and provide recommendations to improve throughput and profitability.*

### 7. Community Dental Health Survey Analysis
[cite_start]*A research project conducted at the Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment to identify barriers to dental care for children with neurodevelopmental disabilities[cite: 3084]. [cite_start]This two-phase study involved collecting preliminary data from 800 patients via intake forms, followed by designing and distributing a 47-question caregiver survey using REDCap[cite: 3087, 3088, 3089, 3090, 3091]. [cite_start]The analysis highlighted key barriers such as financial constraints, appointment availability, and behavioral challenges, providing actionable insights for the clinic to enhance patient care and health outcomes[cite: 3127, 3129, 3155, 3156, 3157].*
