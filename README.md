## Portfolio Projects

Here is a selection of projects that demonstrate my analytical and problem-solving abilities.

### 1. State of Missouri - Cronin Award for Procurement Excellence
[cite_start]*As a recent graduate with a software background, I was identified as a critical team member on a process improvement initiative that won the 2024 NASPO Cronin Finalist Award[cite: 991, 993, 3526]. [cite_start]I helped the team leverage Smartsheet and Tableau, which were implemented to analyze performance data and create real-time dashboards[cite: 975, 987]. [cite_start]This new data-driven process resulted in a **62% decrease in overdue procurement bids** ("Tableau Reds") and a **31.4% reduction in average turnaround time** for key contracts[cite: 1994, 1996].*

### 2. Healthcare Patient Flow Simulation
[cite_start]*Led a capstone team to build a high-fidelity Simio simulation of the University of Missouri Hospital, modeling 16 service lines to identify patient flow bottlenecks[cite: 514, 592]. [cite_start]The model served as a low-cost, low-risk tool for executives to test high-stakes strategic decisions, such as changes in discharge times or responses to increased patient demand[cite: 519, 767, 786, 841].*

### 3. Operating Room Utilization Optimization
[cite_start]*An award-winning research project using FlexSim and a binary search algorithm to optimize OR scheduling, maximizing utilization while adhering to ethical constraints like limiting staff overtime to 90 minutes[cite: 1516, 1612, 1663]. [cite_start]The final recommended configuration achieved **78% OR utilization with zero median staff overtime**[cite: 356, 1852].*

### 4. Machine Learning Sales Forecast for Walmart
[cite_start]*Developed and evaluated four machine learning models (Linear Regression, Lasso, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to predict weekly holiday sales for Walmart[cite: 1156, 1157, 1158, 1159]. [cite_start]The tuned Gradient Boosting model performed best, identifying Temperature, CPI, and Unemployment as the most significant predictive factors for sales volume[cite: 1232, 1233].*

### 5. EMR Nurse Workload & Burnout Analysis
*Conducted a statistical analysis of EMR log data from an ICU to investigate nurse workload distribution. [cite_start]Using a Chi-Square goodness-of-fit test, I proved that EMR task frequency was not uniform among nurses (p-value < 0.05), providing a data-driven basis for tailoring resource allocation to reduce nurse burnout and improve efficiency[cite: 1261, 1266, 1269, 1478, 3242, 3244, 3249].*

### 6. Restaurant Process Improvement & Simulation
[cite_start]*A full-scale analysis of a Panchero's restaurant using Lean principles, line balancing, and Simio simulation to identify bottlenecks and provide recommendations to improve throughput and profitability[cite: 11, 25].*
