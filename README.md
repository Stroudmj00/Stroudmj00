# Michael Stroud

**Healthcare Data Scientist & Industrial Engineer**

A Healthcare Data Scientist and Industrial Engineer who bridges the gap between physical operations and digital intelligence. I apply machine learning and statistical analysis to diagnose systemic inefficiencies, then leverage simulation and mathematical optimization to design, test, and deploy robust, data-driven solutions. My work focuses on driving efficiency and enhancing decision-making in complex healthcare and government environments.

### [2. MUHC Patient Flow Simulation (Best Engineering Capstone)](./projects/2_MUHC_Patient_Flow_Simulation/)
*Led an award-winning capstone team to engineer a predictive simulation model to forecast ER bed shortages. The model provides hospital executives with a low-cost, low-risk tool to test high-stakes operational strategies and was named the **Best 2023 Engineering Capstone Project**.*

### [3. State of Missouri Onboarding Analysis (Iron Viz Finalist)](./projects/3_State_of_Missouri_Onboarding_Analysis/)
*As a finalist in the State of Missouri's Iron Viz competition, I analyzed employee onboarding survey data to prove that smaller team sizes are directly correlated with higher employee engagement and job satisfaction. This work was recognized as one of the top five submissions.*

### [4. IISE OR Simulation Competition (Award-Winning)](./projects/4_IISE_OR_Simulation_Competition/)
*This research project used a **Binary Search algorithm** to find the optimal balance between case scheduling and nurse staffing, achieving a **26% improvement in OR utilization** with zero median staff overtime. This work won **2nd place** in the poster competition and **3rd place** in the IISE regional technical paper competition.*

### [5. Product Backorder Prediction](./projects/5_Product_Backorder_Prediction/)
*Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict product backorders. The final model (Isolation Forest → PCA → Random Forest) successfully identifies **74% of all true backorders** on unseen data, enabling a shift from reactive to proactive inventory planning.*

### [6. MUHC Clinical Workload Analysis (Award-Winning)](./projects/6_MUHC_Clinical_Workload_Analysis/)
*This award-winning research used a **Chi-Square Goodness of Fit test** to analyze EMR log data, statistically proving that EMR workload is not uniformly distributed among ICU nurses. This work provides a data-driven basis for tailoring resource allocation to mitigate burnout.*
