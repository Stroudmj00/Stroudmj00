## Portfolio Projects

Here is a selection of projects that demonstrate my analytical and problem-solving abilities.

### 1. State of Missouri - Cronin Award for Procurement Excellence
[cite_start]*As a data analyst for the state, I was the key team member on a process improvement initiative that won the 2024 NASPO Cronin Finalist Award for Procurement Excellence[cite: 557, 870, 3373]. [cite_start]I helped design and implement a new turnaround time management process using Smartsheet and Tableau dashboards to analyze performance data[cite: 562, 886, 887, 888, 3392, 3393]. [cite_start]This resulted in a **62% decrease in overdue procurement bids** and a **31.4% reduction in average turnaround time** for key contracts[cite: 896, 898].*

### 2. Healthcare Patient Flow Simulation
[cite_start]*Led a capstone team to build a high-fidelity Simio simulation of the University of Missouri Hospital, modeling 16 service lines to identify patient flow bottlenecks[cite: 1, 80, 249]. [cite_start]The model served as a low-cost, low-risk tool for executives to test high-stakes strategic decisions, such as changes in discharge times or responses to increased patient demand[cite: 8, 13, 250, 427].*

### 3. Operating Room Utilization Optimization
[cite_start]*An award-winning research project using FlexSim and a binary search algorithm to optimize OR scheduling[cite: 1761, 2508]. [cite_start]The goal was to maximize OR utilization while adhering to ethical constraints like limiting staff overtime to 90 minutes[cite: 1771, 1866, 1896, 2569]. [cite_start]The final recommended configuration achieved **78% OR utilization with zero median staff overtime**[cite: 2655, 2653].*

### 4. Anomaly Detection


### 5. EMR Nurse Workload & Burnout Analysis
[cite_start]*Conducted a statistical analysis of EMR log data from an ICU to investigate nurse workload distribution[cite: 583, 2259]. [cite_start]Using a Chi-Square goodness-of-fit test, I proved that EMR task frequency was not uniform among nurses (p-value < 0.05)[cite: 590, 764]. [cite_start]This provides a data-driven basis for tailoring resource allocation to reduce nurse burnout and improve efficiency[cite: 598, 2270].*
