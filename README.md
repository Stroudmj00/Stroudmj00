# Michael Stroud

**Industrial Engineer & Data Scientist**

An Industrial Engineer and Data Scientist who bridges the gap between physical operations and digital intelligence. I apply machine learning and statistical analysis to diagnose systemic inefficiencies, then leverage simulation and mathematical optimization to design, test, and deploy robust, data-driven solutions. My work focuses on driving efficiency and enhancing decision-making in complex environments like government and healthcare.

### Portfolio Projects

### 1. Turnaround Time Management (Cronin Award Finalist)
As a Data Analyst for the State of Missouri, I spearheaded a data-driven initiative to improve procurement operations. This project earned 4th place in a national showcase (NASPO Cronin Award Finalist) and was featured on LinkedIn by Governor Parson.

* **Analysis & Process Control:** Performed an initial analysis to identify the dominant factors impacting procurement duration: contract value and evaluation method. I used this to establish distinct project categories, each with a tailored turnaround time goal. To monitor the new process, I implemented a Statistical Process Control (SPC) framework within Tableau, automatically flagging out-of-control projects for immediate review.
* **BI & Performance Monitoring:** Designed and deployed a new turnaround time management process using Smartsheet for project management and Tableau for real-time BI dashboards. This system transformed the division by centralizing project tracking and providing data-driven insights, leading to a **10.6% improvement in procurement turnaround times** and a **73% reduction in administrative time.**

### 2. Healthcare Patient Flow Simulation (Awarded Best Industrial Engineering Capstone Project)
As a capstone team lead, I engineered a predictive Simio model that forecasted Emergency Room bed shortages for University of Missouri Health Care. This high-fidelity simulation served as a low-cost, low-risk tool for executives to test high-stakes strategic decisions. This work was recognized as the **Best 2023 ISE Capstone Project.**

* **Stochastic Modeling & Validation:** Modeled patient arrivals using an exponential distribution derived from historical data analysis. The model's inputs and outputs were rigorously validated against historical operational data to ensure predictive accuracy.
* **Data Engineering & Routing Logic:** Executed a complex data transformation process to convert raw healthcare operational data into a Simio-compatible format. A key innovation was the development of a 4-dimensional Markov chain to handle complex patient routing logic, considering the patient's current location, next destination, point of origin, and path history.

### 3. Operating Room Optimization (Award-Winning Research)
As team lead for the "Si-MU-lation" team, I directed a 6-person team in a research project to configure operating room schedules. We improved OR utilization by 26% by implementing a custom scheduling algorithm in FlexSim, balancing efficiency with ethical constraints like staff overtime. This work was recognized with multiple awards and presented at the IISE 2023 Annual Conference.

### 4. Supply Chain Anomaly Detection for Product Backorders
This project tackled the critical business problem of predicting product backorders to reduce stock-outs and improve customer satisfaction. I developed and benchmarked three unique machine learning pipelines to identify the optimal model. The best-performing pipeline (Isolation Forest → PCA → RandomForest) achieved **82% overall accuracy** and caught **74% of all backorders** on unseen data, enabling a shift from reactive firefighting to proactive inventory planning.

### 5. EMR Nurse Workload & Burnout Analysis (Award-Winning Research)
As an undergraduate researcher, I analyzed a large EMR dataset from a Real-Time Measurement System (RTMS) to investigate the distribution of nurse workload in an ICU.

* **Statistical Inference:** Using **R** with the **`dplyr`** package for data manipulation and analysis, I applied a Chi-Square goodness-of-fit test to the EMR task frequency data.
* **Findings:** The analysis statistically proved that EMR task frequency was not uniform among nurses, rejecting the null hypothesis and providing a data-driven basis for tailoring resource allocation to mitigate nurse burnout. This research placed 3rd and 4th in engineering research poster competitions.
