## Portfolio Projects

### 1. State of Missouri - Cronin Award for Procurement Excellence
*As a Research and Data Analyst, I was a key member of the team whose work on turnaround time management earned the 2024 NASPO George Cronin Finalist Award for Procurement Excellence. Our initiative transformed the state's procurement operations from transactional chaos to strategic, data-driven management. I was one of the three official presenters on this topic at the NASPO Annual Conference.*

*We implemented a new process using Smartsheet and Tableau to track and analyze bid timelines against granular goals. This new system, recognized by Governor Mike Parson for creating real, lasting changes, produced significant, measurable improvements:*
* *The number of overdue bids ("Tableau Reds") was **reduced by 78%**, from 36 to 8, over a 9-month period.*
* *The overall number of dissatisfied customers (bids behind schedule) **decreased by 62%**.*
