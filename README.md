### About Me

A Healthcare Data Scientist and Industrial Engineer who bridges the gap between physical operations and digital intelligence. I apply machine learning and statistical analysis to diagnose systemic inefficiencies, then leverage simulation and mathematical optimization to design, test, and deploy robust, data-driven solutions. My work focuses on driving efficiency and enhancing decision-making in complex healthcare and government environments.
